## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation refers to building out the all the features, including all the sophistication and complexity, then ensuring basic functionality and content is maintained for users with less accessibility. Service workers thus help us implement graceful degradation because if a user does not have access to the internet, through service workers, they are still able to finish the functionality. Service workers are scripts that run in the background of the browser and can intercept and handle network requests, allowing for offline access and caching of essential resources. By using service workers, developers can ensure that even when users face connectivity issues, they can still access core features and content, thereby supporting the principle of graceful degradation.
